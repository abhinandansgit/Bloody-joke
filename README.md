Have fun with Python Jokes (fun.py)

This Python script, fun.py, is designed to bring some laughter your way with a random joke. It utilizes the pyjokes library to fetch jokes and provides an interactive way for you to choose whether you want to hear one.

Installation:

Before using this script, you'll need to install the pyjokes library:

**pip install pyjokes**

Use code with caution.

How it Works:

Import the Library:

The script begins by importing the pyjokes library, which provides access to a collection of jokes.
Get a Random Joke:

The pyjokes.get_joke() function retrieves a random joke from the library's database.
User Interaction:

The script prompts the user with the question: "Want a joke?\nPress 1: "
If the user enters 1 and presses Enter, the script proceeds to display the retrieved joke.
If the user enters anything else or presses Enter without input, the script delivers a playful response: "bloody fool" (you can customize this message if desired).
